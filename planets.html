             <h1>Planets</h1>
            <p>There are 8 planets in our solar system!
                Which means that there are 8 planets that orbit our sun.
                Let's learn more about these 8 planets starting from the closest 
                planet to our sun:

                <h2 class="planetheader">Mercury</h2>
                <p class="planetinfo"> 
                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, and it 
                    is also the smallest planet in it. Since Mercury is the closer to the Sun than Earth,
                    the Sun would appear three times as large as it does here on Earth and it appears brighter.
                    A fun fact about Mercury is that since it is closer to the sun,
                    it travels faster and is the fastest planet in our solar system.
                    Because of this, Mercury's year is only 88 Earth days long.

                <p class="planetinfo">
                    Venus is the second planet closest to the sun in our solar system. Although
                    Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus, Venus is hotter than Mercury in fact it
                    is the hottest planet in our solar system. This is due to the atmosphere
                    on Venus which traps and maintains heat. A fun fact about Venus is that
                    one day on Venus is equal to 243 days here on Earth.

                    70% of Earth's surface is covered in water, and it is the only 
                    planet in our solar system which has liquid water on the surface.
                     Earth is currently the only known planet to contain life.

                    Mars is the fourth planet form the Sun. Mars experiences seasons and

                    Jupiter is the fifth planet form the sun. The stripes and swirls seen on Jupiter's 
                    surface are really clouds of ammonia and water that are floating in its atmosphere. 
                    The giant red spot that can be seen is actually a giant storm that has been active
                    for hundreds of years.

                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant primarily consisting of hydrogen and helium.
                    It is also the second largest planet in the solar system, compared to Earth,
                    Saturn is 95 times the mass of our home planet. Saturn is surrounded by multiple rings,
                    which are mainly made up of pieces of ice and rock.

                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, but it is the third largest planet
                    size wise but not by mass. It is the coldest planet in our
                    solar system, with a low of -218&deg;C (-360&deg;F). A fun fact about
                    this planet is that Uranus' tilt may have been caused by
                    a collision.

                    Neptune is the planet furthest away from the Sun,
                    30 times as far from the Sun as the Earth is. It
                    is an ice giant and it is dark and cold there. Neptune
                    has six rings which surround it. This planet is not visible
                    to the naked eye, and was in feact predicted by mathematics.

                <h2 class="planetheader">Special Mention to Our Dwarf Planet, Pluto</h2>
                <p class="planetinfo">Pluto was known as a planet for 75 years before it was reclassified
                    as a dwarf planet in 2006. This was due to Pluto not
                    clearing the neighborhood around its orbit.
                    Although Pluto is no longer considered a planet,
                    it is still fascinating and worth mentioning.
                    Someinteresting facts about Pluto are that the snow on Pluto
                    is red and the 1/3rd of the dwarf planet is made up of water.
