            <h1>Planets</h1>
            <p>There are 8 planets in our solar system!
                Which means that there are 8 planets that orbit our sun.
                Let's learn more about these 8 planets starting from the closest 
                planet to our sun:

                <h1>Mercury</h1>
                <p>
                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, and it 
                    is also the smallest planet in it. Since Mercury is the closer to the Sun than Earth,
                    the Sun would appear three times as large as it does here on Earth and it appears brighter.
                    A fun fact about Mercury is that since it is closer to the sun,
                    it travels faster and is the fastest planet in our solar system.
                    Because of this, Mercury's year is only 88 Earth days long.

                <p>
                    Venus is the second planet closest to the sun in our solar system. Although
                    Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus, Venus is hotter than Mercury in fact it
                    is the hottest planet in our solar system. This is due to the atmosphere
                    on Venus which traps and maintains heat. A fun fact about Venus is that
                    one day on Venus is equal to 243 days here on Earth.
